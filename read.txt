/***
 * Tree.js
 *
 * This file defines the Tree class. The Tree class serves as a wrapper for a
 * root node, wrapping methods such as addValue or search, but also provides
 * higher-level functionality, such as setting the coordinates of the entire
 * tree, or drawing the entire tree.
 *
 * The tree class is also responsible for animating itself, and relies only
 * on an instance of the Controls class to provide the interval between frames
 * of animation
